## Computer Science: The Mechanization of Abstraction
http://i.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs/ch01.pdf

Computer science is a science of abstraction: creating the right model for thinking about a problem and devising the appropriate mechanisable techniques to solve it. OTOH sciences tend to deal with the universe as it is. Computer scientists must create abstractions of real-world problems that can be understood by the user and the computer.

Some abstrations are quick direct: e.g. "Propositional logic" used to model circuits using logical expressions. But even these are leaky.

    Abstractions need not be hard. We can abstract away uneccessary details to 
    concentrate on the core problem.

Introduction to: Data Model (the abstractions used to describe problems), Data Structure (how data is represented in the program), Algorithms (techniques used to manipulate data to solve problems).

## Data Models

The models are used in two main contexts. 

1. Models (such as graphs) are frequently used to help formulate solutions to problems. 
2. Models are also associated with programming languages and computers (e.g. abstractions for characters, strings, numbers)
