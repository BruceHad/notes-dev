# JQuery

Jquery is a javascript library that abstracts away the differences between browsers and provides a shorthand for manipulating the Dom, using Ajax type queries, and doing fancy effects and animations.

## Basics

JQuery uses $ as a shorthand for any JQuery method call, of which there are apparently two types:

1. Methods that run on collections using $.fn.
2. Utility methods such as $.data and $.ajax that don't rely on collections.

## Document Ready

The DOM cannot be queried until the full thing has loaded, so it's important to not make any calls until the document has loaded.

    $(document).ready(function(){
        // jquery code
    });

## Selectors

In JQuery you can use selectors to identify elements. 

    $("#foo")

This identifies the element with id="foo". 

You can also use the .find() and .filter() methods to give you more control over your collections.

You can use this to apply changes to your collection.

    $("#foo").css("background-color", "red");

If you want to make multiple changes to the same element, you can, if you want, combine them in one call.

    $("#foo").css({
        "background-color": "red",
        "font-weight": bold"
    });

If you are doing a lot of different manipulation on an element, it is recommended that the selector is bound to a variable, so that the same dom query isn't called multiple times.

    var foo = $("#foo");

You can get a similar benefit from chaining all the calls together.

    $("#foo").css("background-color", "red").appendTo("#bar");

Not sure I like this. It's difficult to read and troubleshoot.
