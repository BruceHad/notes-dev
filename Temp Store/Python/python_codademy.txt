# Python Notes

## Dot Notation Tip

When calculating the length of the string you can use the method len() like so:

    len("String")

But when you convert to uppercase you use the method upper() like so.

    "String".upper()

This difference in syntax is apparently because len() is a general method not just tied to string (e.g. it can be used on arrays). Not sure that makes sense to me.

I'd originally thought that len() was a general function and upper() was a method of the string object, but the text calls them both methods. We'll get to functions later.

# Functions

Functions are defined as follows:

    def spam():
        """ Docstring """
    	print "Eggs!"

And are called using the following:

    spam()

Functions can take **parameters** between the parentheses so that you can pass **arguments** to the function.

There are also something called splat arguments that can be used when you don't know how many arguments are going to be needed.

    def favorite_actors(*args):
        """Prints out your favorite actorS (plural!)"""
        print "Your favorite actors are:" , args
        
        
    favorite_actors("Michael Palin", "John Cleese", "Graham Chapman")
