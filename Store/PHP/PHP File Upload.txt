# PHP Post Method Upload

This lets you upload text and binary files.

In the form tag you must specify the enctype:

    enctype = "multipart/formdata"

You can also specify the maximum file type by entering a hidden form field (prior to the upload field).

    <input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="30000" />

Value is measured in bytes. This provides nice user side validation, but shouldn't be trusted.

The global S_FILES variable contains all the uploaded file information.

$_FILE['userfile']['name'] -- original file name.
['type'] -- mime type.
['size'] -- fiel size in bytes.
['tmp_name'] -- new, temporary name.
['error'] -- possible error codes.

Files will be stored in the servers default temporary directory (apparently /tmp/ on linux). This location can be overridden in the php.ini file.

    upload_tmp_dir = /your_www/tmp/

Or you can apparently amend it in the script.

    ini_set('upload_tmp_dir', '/your_www/tmp/');

## Working Example

Uploading images is a common use case, so I'm not about to re-invent the wheel here. I can use the class.upload.php script.
