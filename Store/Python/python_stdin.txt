Fucking hell, I forget this every time.

Python has a number of ways of handling inputs, depending on which version you are using. I can never fucking remember the easy way to get IdeOne and Spoj to read inputs.

A nice wee trick for the program to run on it's own is to call the main function:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # do what you need to do.

raw_input() reads the first line of an input. It appears to terminate at the end of line so you can use it to read in multiple lines.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    inputOne = input()
    inputTwo = input()
    inputThree = input()

This will read in the following and assign each to a different variable.

    1
    2
    3

Obviously this only works for simple inputs when you know how many inputs you are going to get up from.

If you need more control you can use 

    import sys
    for line in sys.stdin:
        print line,
