Four basic concepts for keeping your code clean:

1. Keep personal quirks out of it. 

(How do you recognise personal quirks, esp. as opposed to 'idiomatic' code).

2. Single Responsibility Principle (Modular code)

TDD has benifit of forcing people to apply principles such as stateless code.

3. Avoid using language extension and libararies that do not play well with your IDE.

4. Make it readable

5. Remember that you will forget everything, and will have to read the code later.

Similarities between code and english: paragraphs with single point to get across, short sentences, organisation, abstraction.
