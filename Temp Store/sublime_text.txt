minimap shows a small version of your code. You will never ever need the scrollbar again and can instantly browse through the currently opened file with ease.

The sidebar is hidden by default (to show it press Ctrl + K, Ctrl + B). In its default state it only shows the currently opened files, but can be extended to a fully-fledged file browser. 

But even without that Sublime Text 2 makes it a breeze to find and open files. Just hit Ctrl + P, type a few characters and magically a list of all matching files gets displayed, even when not entered in sequence. 

Better recall its name: "Goto Anything", which is incredibly useful and will be your single best companion. No more searching for that single file you can't remember the exact name in a long, long list of other files. Even subdirectories are considered. 

"Goto Anything" even offers more. Enter a colon (:) to jump to a line (shortcut: Ctrl + G / Control + G), with an @ all previously used methods are shown (Ctrl + R / Command + R) and entering a # allows you to search inside the document (CTRL + ; / Control + ;).

There are two ways to work with projects in Sublime Text 2:

* File > Open Folder, which starts with the chosen folder as the basis for your work. All file operations relate to this directory, like "Goto Anything" and the Advanced Search.
* Projects: Apart from the above-noted approach, there is also the neat possibility to combine your files and directories into projects. Just go to a folder like noted above, open some files and choose Project > Save project as to save the project file onto your hard drive. 

To switch between them just hit Ctrl + Alt + P. Previous projects can also be found under Project > Recent projects. As soon a file or folder within the project is changed or added, these changes are preserved when you close the project. Even the position of the caret gets saved.
