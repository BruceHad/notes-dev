# Programming and Development Notes

A central repository to organise notes, writing and documentation from my learning to become a programmer.

I like to write while I read. It helps me learn (or at least makes me think I'm doing something productive). So there will be a whole mess of stuff in here, but it probably isn't of any interest to anyone but myself.
