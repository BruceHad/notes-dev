## Week 1:

Terrence Sejkowski & Barbara Oakley

There seems to be two modes of thinking: focused and diffuse. In the diffuse mode of thinking you can look at a subject broadley and open up new paths that haven’t been used before.

[Pinball analogy]

Seems you can’t be in both modes simultaneously.

[Dali and Thomas Edison story] 

Let your mind drift and it will think about things in diffuse mode, bouncing around ideas, with no focus. 
If you then ‘wake up’, you bring those diffuse thoughts with you. 

Do this repeatedly to build the neural structure for thinking.

[Weightlifting analogy]

Brain weighs around 3lb and uses 10x more energy per weight than any other part of the body. 
We are generally not consciously aware of our brain working. Lot of work going on subconsciously.
There are a million billion synapses. These are tiny, hair like strands (1/20th the size of human hair). Synapses and the strength of connections are constantly being re-arranged, the brain is dynamic. It’s now possible to view the synapses in living brains and watch them change.

Procrastination

Starting work you’d rather not do activates pain centres of the brain, and the brain starts to look for ways to avoid it. This lessens as you begin the work.

The pomodoro is a technique that uses 25 minute blocks with no interruptions. Use a timer. Followed by a reward.
Math and science can be difficult. Abstract ideas. It’s important to practice, to strengthen the synapses. Practice makes permanent. Intense focus, followed by relaxation (diffuse), which helps you sort out the information you are learning.
When thinking about the past, we access long term memory. Focussing on a task, working memory. 
Working memory holds around 4 chunks of information. Repetition is needed to maintain memories in the working memory. 
Memories moved to long term memory need to be re-visited in order to strengthen access and ensure you can find them again. Spaced repetition techniques help with this.

Sleep is important. Washes away metabolic toxins. And it tidies up ideas, erases less important and strengthens important patterns. Going over your study before sleep increases the likelihood of dreaming about it.
Get involved (learn by doing). 

Learn from experts.

Ask questions. Active engagements vs passive listening.

Exercise a good time for diffuse learning. Notebook

Context switching (some people are better than others).

(In rats) Having a rich environment helps with developing new neurons.

(In rats) in the absence of a rich environment, exercise helps.

Summary: 

1. Analogy is powerful technique for learning. 
2. 2. Focused and diffuse mode of thinking. 
3. 3. Brain builds structure slowly, over time. 
4. 4. Procrastination distracts us from concentrating. 
5. 5. Pomodoro combines focussed and diffuse thinking. 
6. 6. Working and long term memory. 
7. 7. Spaced repetition helps fix something in long term memory. 
8. 8. Sleep,exercise and rich environments help.

## Week 2: 

### Chunking

Chunks are small pieces of knowledge that are easy to access. 

Illusions of competence - ineffective methods of study.

Overlearning - digs ruts. (instead ‘interleave’ with ‘intelligent variety’)

When first look at brand new concept it don’t make much sense. Chunking is the mental leap that lets you unite bits of information together. Memorising facts doesn’t help understand.

Working memory hangs out in the prefrontal cortex (front of brain).

Octopus analogy.

Chunks are units of information bound together through meaning or use. Bit like abstracting a complex thing into a single item that can be held in working memory. Names are labels for chunks. (Physically a chunk is a network of neurons that are commonly fired together). Chunking helps the brain run more efficiently. 

Chunks can be built from mini-chunks.

Focus on the information you want to chunk.

Understand the idea you are trying to chunk.

Practice. Gain context (how and when), with practice. How the chunk fits into the bigger picture. Top down gains context, bottom up practices how chunks fit into the context.

Context is important. Lectures or reading give you an outline of the main concepts. Fill in the details, practicing the chunks within the context. The chunks have to connect to other chunks within the context.

Recall - After you’ve read material, look away and try to recall what you just read. More effective than simply re-reading. Let time pass, so it becomes like spaced repetition.

Recall outwith your usual space for studying strengthens the memory.

Illusion of competence - re-reading gives the feeling of learning without being effective.
Testing verifies if you’ve grasped and idea, or just fooling yourself.

Mistakes help correct your thinking.

Chunks are pathways that are commonly used together. Can be thought of as a collection of ideas that form a concept. Mini-chunks fit together for larger chunks. Chunks can be held in short-term memory. Recall shortly after reading helps embed memories. Recall in different situations strengthens memories. Learning combines high level context, learning the chunks within that context, and how they fit together. Learning chunks through:

1. Concentrated leaning
2. Understanding 
3. Practice

Build a library of chunks. As you fill in each chunk, you get a larger picture. Chunk library can be organised, and classifications, that make it easier to make connections, and learn new things.

Sequential thinking - focused mode.

Holistic, intuitive thinking - diffuse mode.

These modes work together.

Overlearning can help develop automatic thinking. But comes with opportunity cost, illusion of competence. Balance study by focussing on the more difficult, rather than the stuff you’ve mastered.

Einstellung (mindset) - existing knowledge may prevent access to correct solution. Rut. Unlearn while learning new skills.
Sinking - jumping ahead before learning the basics.

Interleaving - jump back a forth between different problems.

### Motivation

Motivation is controlled by dopamine. Dopamine is released when we have a unexpected reward. Loss of dopamine leads to a lack of motivation. Parkinson's is a severe loss of dopamine. Serotonin is linked to social activity, and risk taking behaviour.


1. Chunks are pieces of information, neural connection, bound together through use (and often meaning). Chunks can get bigger and more complex, but easier to access. 
2. Build with focus, understanding and practice.
3. Test frequently. 
4. Recall (form of testing) help chunking process along. Build stronger memory. Recall in different contexts. 
5. Transfer - chunks in one discipline can help understand new ideas.
6. Interleave learning.
7. Focus on things you struggle with. Deliberate practice.
8. Avoid ruts. Einstellung
9. Try!

## Week 3: Procrastination & Memory

Building memory takes time, so procrastination is bad. One tool is the pomodoro.

Analogy of drinking arsenic, building up immunity from tiny doses.

Procrastination is easy to fall into, willpower is hard. Shouldn’t be used to fend off procrastination.

Procrastinate about things that make us feel uncomfortable, shift to something more enjoyable.

Once you’ve learned a skill, your brain takes over and works by habit, freeing your mind for other activities. The skill has been ‘chunked’. Habits can be good or bad. 

Four parts: 

1. The cue. 
2. The routine (zombie mode, habitual response).
3. The reward. 
4. The belief.

Procrastination is easy habit, reward is easy and immediate.

Difficult task are associated with negative feelings that we automatically try to avoid. Reframe things:

Tell yourself to get on with it.

Focus on process, not product. Don’t think about the outcome, focus on building the processes. The brain likes processes as it can complete them, regardless of the outcome.

When a distraction arises, let it flow by.

Look to change your reaction to a cue. Apply willpower to this small task (minimise). 

Cues can be 1. Location, 2. Time, 3. How you feel, 4. Reactions. Cues can be damaging.

The routine. Instead of studying, brain diverts to something more painful. Should actively focus on learning. Ritual can be helpful. 
The reward. Investigate why you are procrastination, can it be substituted somehow. Gamify. The better you get, the more enjoyable. This can be the reward.

Belief that you can do it.

Task list. Have a weekly task list. And a daily task list. Write this the night before. Tasks on your mind take up cognitive load. Shift them to the list.

Try to make it process oriented. Mix the tasks up. Give yourself breaks. Plan your quitting time. Try to work on the most important and most difficult tasks first.

Summary:

1. Learning builds solid neural scaffolds. These are more solid if arranged in regular, consistent blocks.
2. Keep a plan or journal to track goals.
3. Commit to tasks each day (night before)
4. Process oriented.
5. Provide rewards (deliberately delay reward).
6. Watch for procrastination cues.
7. Trust your process.
8. Eat frogs first.
